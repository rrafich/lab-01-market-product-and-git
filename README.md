By the end of this lab you should be able to:

- Explain the basic architecture of a real-world digital product in terms of modules, data flow, and deployment.
    
- Identify which tech roles work on which parts of that product, and which general skills are shared across roles.
    
- Use GitHub issues, branches, and pull requests to structure your work and get a peer review.


## How the lab works

1. **Fork** this repo to your GitHub account.
2. **Create GitHub issues** for the tasks in [`LAB_STORY.md`](./LAB_STORY.md) using the provided templates.
3. Add a classmate to the repo as a contributor.
4. For each task:
   - Create/assign an **issue**.
   - Implement the task on a **feature branch**.
   - Open a **Pull Request**.
   - Assign the classmate in the PR as the reviewer.
   - After the review, make the necessary changes and get the classmate to approve the PR.
   - Merge the PR to the `main` branch.
5. At the end:
   - Be ready to demonstrate the completed tasks to the TA.
